Isha Lamba & Cole Brazell
Project 4


1. The click of a mouse triggers the world event, which is the spawning of a volcano.
2.Using the background class, we create a volcano image at the click, creating flames from the image file around the location the volcano is placed at.
3.The goal of changing an existing entity, which we chose to do with miner, is accomplished by turning them into flames which move randomly (how we chose to change behavior).
4. The new entity is an explosion, which we have created a class for and aim to spawn around the volcano, again in random movements.
5. Cole helped create the explosion class, Isha organized imaging/background, and both worked on VirtualWorld over zoom to implement clicking and movement design.
